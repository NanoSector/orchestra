The name is a complement to [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), the PHP package manager.

## Why?

In a microservice setting, a lot of different software packages and versions are run in parallel.
This makes it hard to keep track of all the different pieces of the puzzle (or orchestra, if you will).

### Why not X?

There are several ways to achieve a system like this, such as Prometheus. I really wanted a user-friendly
and easy to maintain system which is opinionated in the way it receives and shows its data.

## How?

*Orchestra* will act as a software inventory system. It will be able to collect data about different
software packages or even operating systems, while being user-friendly to operate.

### Will this do X?

Maybe! Create a feature request, and we can talk about it.

## How do I set it up?

Not yet, the project is still in startup phase.
